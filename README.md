# CPU_8bit
This project involves designing an 8-bit CPU in Verilog, covering basic operations like data loading, arithmetic, and logic. It includes a Verilog module, testbench, and simulation with Icarus Verilog, visualized in GTKWave. It serves as an educational tool for understanding fundamental CPU operations and digital logic.
